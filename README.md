# Mean Reversal Research

## Conducted by [Venn Reddy](https://github.com/vennreddy490) and [Stephen Sulimani](https://github.com/StephenSulimani)
## Under the guidance of Dr. Ingrid Maria Hybinette, The University of Georgia, and Dr. Tucker Balch, Emory University.

This research was highly inspired by [Cluster-driven Hierarchical Representation of Large Asset Universes for Optimal Portfolio Construction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3677052.3698676).


### Part 1:

The first part of this research is to analyze each of the 11 S&P 500 sectors.

Over a to-be-determined interval, we will analyze the most overperforming and most underperforming
stocks from each sector. With those stocks, we will then hold a long position on the most overperforming
stock, and a short position on the most underperforming stock, for a total of 22 positons. We will hold
these positions for a to-be-determined interval. Our goal is to see if these stocks revert back to their
sector's mean.
